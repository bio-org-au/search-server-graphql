# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
# Note: quotes around value of 'on' are essential to get literal value of 'on' 
# loaded into the column rather than t.
